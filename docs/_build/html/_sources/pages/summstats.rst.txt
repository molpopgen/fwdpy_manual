Calculating summary statistics 
======================================================

Users will typically want to calculate summary statistics based on samples drawn from simulated populations.  There are three ways to accomplish that:

* Write your own functions.
* Use the Python package pylibseq_, which provides an interface to the libsequence_ C++11 library.

The pylibseq_ package provides a complete API for processing samples.
