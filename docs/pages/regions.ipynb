    "Example: Modeling regional variation in mutation and recombination\n",
    "======================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Several of the simulation routines allow the details of the mutation and recombination models to vary along a \"sequence\" or \"region\".  A user is able to specify the details of such variation by passing *lists* to package functions.  For example, you are able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vary the neutral mutation rate along a sequence.\n",
    "* Vary the distribution of selection coefficients (and the dominance associated with selected mutations) along a sequence.\n",
    "* Vary the recombination rate along a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of such variation along a region is *discrete*.  A region is specified by a beginning, and end, and a weight, plus any additional data required to specify selection coefficients, dominance, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------\n",
    "The models are parameterized through Python's \"new-style\" class system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutation rates, recombination rates, and a weighting system\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "A simulation will typically have a mutation rate, :math:`\\\\mu`, which represents the mean of a Poisson number of mutations per gamete per generation), and a recombination rate, :math:`r`, which again is the mean of Poisson number of crossover events (per diploid, per generation).  These parameters are the _total_ rates across an entire simulated region.  Variation in these parameters along the region are affected by a set of positions coupled with \"weights\", which the user specifies using S4 classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base class: :class:`fwdpy.fwdpy.Region`\n",
    "\n",
    "A :class:`fwdpy.fwdpy.Region` is an Python class with the following members:\n",
    "\n",
    "* :math:`b`, which is the beginning/start of the region. The type is \"float\". \n",
    "* :math:`e`, which is the end/stop of the region. The type is \"float\".\n",
    "* :math:`w`, which is a weighting factor associated with the region. The type is \"float\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The members are used to inform the C++ code about the relative abundance of new mutations or recombination events will occur in what region.  Briefly, the number of events that occur in region :math:`i` are proportional to :math:`w_i/\\sum_i w`, *i.e*, the weight assigned to region :math:`i` divided by the sum of weights assigned to all regions.  The weights for mutation events and for recombination events are considered separately.  Thus, in order to model a correlation between mutational processes and recombination, it is up to the user to generate regions whose weights are correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "fwdpy allows the :math:`w` slot to be interpreted in one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is *not*  affected by the length of region.  Interally, the weight assigned is simply :math:`w`. \n",
    "* It is affected by the length of a region :math:`(e - b)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two options are determined by arguments to class constructors, which we will see in examples below.  The latter is the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two approaches allow for considerable modeling flexibility.  For example, the latter approach allows :math:`w` to be interpreted as a \"per base-pair\" rate.  Imagine that you wanted to simulate variation in recombination along discrete 100 kilobase chunks, and the rate of crossing-over *per base pair* increases in each chunk, and includes an initial chunk with no recombination:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. start=1,stop= :math:`10^5`, :math:`r_{bp}=0`\n",
    "2. start= :math:`10^5`,stop= :math:`2 \\times 10^5`, :math:`r_{bp}=10^{-8}`\n",
    "3. start= :math:`2 \\times 10^5`,stop= :math:`3 \\times 10^5`, :math:`r_{bp}=10^{-7}`  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This model boils down to the relative number of crossing overs per region occuring in the ratio :math:`0 : 10^{-8} : 10^{-7}`.  This is easily represented using fwdpy's classes:"
